# Polygon_Mapping
// Author: Arash Nemati Hayati 
This program maps an arbitrary polygon into a structured two-dimensional grid of an arbitrary size
It's assumed that the polygon is inside the defined grid
If a cell intersects with the polygon, the code prints X 
if a cell is outside the polygon, the code prints O 
If a cell is inside the polygon, the code prints I
